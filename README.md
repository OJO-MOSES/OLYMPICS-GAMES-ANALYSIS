### Introduction

Welcome to “Exploring Olympic Dataset 1900 to 2016”, a data analysis project diving into the rich history of the Olympic Games. The Olympics, with its origins dating back to ancient Greece, has evolved into a global phenomenon, showcasing the pinnacle of athletic prowess and international camaraderie
In this project, I explored aspects such as medal distributions, participation rates, dominant countries, records, and the evolution of sports included in the Games. Through visualizations and statistical analyses, I seek to answer intriguing questions about the Olympics and its impacts in the world stage.

### Projects Overview

In this project, we embark on a journey through the data of various Olympic events, spanning decades of competitions. By analyzing this extensive dataset, I aim to uncover insights into trends, achievements, and changes in the landscape of the Olympics over the years.

### Data Sources

The primary data source for this project is an extensive dataset containing information on Olympic events, athletes, medals, and countries from year 1900 to 2016. It can be [Downloaded Here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Sr-sl_HdM-_crELIKHuaWAMuFaTnsa_).

### Tools and Techniques.

For this analysis, I utilized Excel (power query) for cleaning and analyzing, and 
Power BI for modelling, and an interactive and explanatory visualization.

### Data Cleaning

The data was containing errors, duplicates, and blanks or missing values. Each document was reviewed to confirm the data types, errors, and duplicates. The following steps were taken during the data cleaning process;
- Handling missing values
- Removing duplicates
- Data formatting
- Correcting data errors
- Data type conversion
- Used DAX to create new measures, calculated columns and tables.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

- Medals distribution by genders
- Medals distribution by sports
- Medals distribution among top 10 players
- Medals distribution by age
- Medals distribution by seasons and country
- Total sports
- Total medals
- Total countries that participated

### Results 

1. The male won medals most by 72.53% total 196.37k medals.
2. The sport with the highest count of medals was athletics.
3. The top 10 countries by the distribution of medals are as follows
4. Micheal Fred has the highest medals, total 28 and the highest gold winner with 23 golds.
5. The total medals over the years was 39.77k medals
6. The total sports was 66
7. The total number of countries that participated was 136


### Recommendations

Based on the dataset analyzed, it is important the various concerned stakeholders use the analysis to ;
1. Identify the emerging trends in sport participation, audience engagement, and global interest.
2. Identify the sports that are underrepresented or less popular in terms of participation or viewership. Consider investing resources in promoting these sports to increase diversity and appeal to broader audience.
3. identify countries or regions with potentials for growth in Olympic sports. Allocate resources, such as funding and training programs, strategically to support these regions and enhance competitiveness.
4. Implement initiatives to support underrepresented groups and ensure equal opportunities for athletics from all backgrounds. 
By implementing these recommendations, stakeholders can leverage data-driven insights to enhance the overall success, impact, and legacy of the Olympic Games.

### Limitations

Here are some of the limitations attached to this analysis;
The dataset only includes data from 1900 to 2016, which could restrict the analysis of recent Olympics trends, and the dataset came with potentials issues such as missing values.
